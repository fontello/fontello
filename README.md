This tool lets you combine icon webfonts for your own project. With fontello you can:

1. shrink glyph collections, minimizing font size
2. merge symbols from several fonts into a single file
3. access large sets of professional-grade open source icons

Now it's trivial to make a custom icon webfont, exactly for your needs.
First, select the icons you like. Then update glyph codes (optional), and
download your webfont bundle. We generate everything you need, ready for publishing
on your website!


## Compatibility

1. Desktop is fully supported. IE6-7 requires alternate CSS.
2. Mobiles - all modern systems work without problems. There are limits on very old androids
   and rare browsers. Also, Windows Mobile IE9 sucks, as IE  usually does :) . See
   [details](http://blog.kaelig.fr/post/33373448491/testing-font-face-support-on-mobile-and-tablet).


## Developers API

Fontello allows easy scripting, to implement different convenient features:

1. Open site from command line, with your configuration, and import edited project
    - [Makefile example](https://gist.github.com/puzrin/5537065). That's a live working code, used
      for development of fontello itself.
2. Writing website plugins, to import/export icons via admin panel.

When more examples available, those will be added here.


### API methods

1. `POST http://fontello.com/` creates a session with your config and
   return you `session_id`. You can use it later to open fontello with your configuration
   and to automatically download your font. Session is stored for 24h. POST params
   (form-encoded):
    - `config` - (Required) content of `config.json` for your font
    - `url` - (Optional) if used, download button will link to your admin panel, where you can
      run importing script.
2. `http://fontello.com/[session_id]` - opening fontello with your config preloaded.
   When you edit font, your config is automatically sent to server
3. `http://fontello.com/[session_id]/get` - download your font.

Note. When you open site via API url, `download` button will have another text.


### Examples

* [Makefile](https://gist.github.com/puzrin/5537065) - quick load iconic font
  from your project via CLI & save result back.
* [fontello-cli](https://github.com/paulyoung/fontello-cli) - the same, as above,
  but written in `node.js`. If you don't like `make` utility, then
  `fontello-cli` is for you :)
* [fontello_rails_converter](https://github.com/railslove/fontello_rails_converter) - Ruby CLI gem for interacting with the API.  Additional features (Sass conversion) for Rails integration, but should work for every project.
* [grunt-fontello](https://github.com/jubalm/grunt-fontello) - lightweight integration with grunt
