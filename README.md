Fontello - iconic fonts scissors
================================

Website: [fontello.com](http://fontello.com/)

This tool lets you combine iconic webfonts for your own project. With fontello you can:

1. shrink glyph collections, minimizing font size
2. merge symbols from several fonts into a single file
3. access large sets of professional-grade open source icons

Now it's trivial to make a custom iconic webfont, exactly for your needs.
First, select the icons you like. Then update glyph codes (optional), and
download your webfont bundle. We generate everything you need, ready for publishing
on your website!

Don't forget about donations... These are some awesome icons, available with an 
open source license :) . A donation is the best way to express gratitude for our work.


## Embedded Fonts <a name="embedded"></a>

Fontello comes with the following embedded set of iconic fonts:

Please, note that these embedded fonts differ from the original files. We did some
modifications to unify characteristics such as scale, ascent/descent andalignment.
