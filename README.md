Fontomas - iconic fonts scissors
================================

[Run right now in your browser!](http://nodeca.github.com/fontomas/) This tool
helps to combine iconic webfonts for your project. With fontomas you can:

1. make a limited symbols subset, with reduced font size
2. merge symbols from several fonts to single file
3. access large collections of professional-grade open source icons

Now it's trivial to customise fonts for your needs with 3 simple step.
At first, you select needed symbols on source fonts. Then rearrange those
on destination font. After that, you can download SVG font and make webpack
via [fontsquirrel generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator)
or other services.

(*) Currently we support loading only SVG fonts & [Cufon files](http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/).
Other formats will be available, when we implement server-side scripts.
